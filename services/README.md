# Services

This folder holds data ingestion and enrichment utilities that keep the TransitScope demo running on free, open data.

## Included scripts

- `ingest-bods.md` – notes for pulling the Bus Open Data Service (BODS) GTFS files without any paid tooling.
- `replay.py` – optional Python helper that replays a recorded GTFS-RT feed into the local backend while developing offline.

The actual scripts are intentionally lightweight so you can customise them for your city or operator of choice.
